# SmartQueue – Real-Time Mobile Queue Management System

## 📌 Project Overview

SmartQueue is a real-time mobile queue management system designed to reduce physical waiting lines in service centers such as hospitals, banks, restaurants, and administrative offices.

The application allows users to join queues remotely, monitor their position in real-time, and receive notifications when it is their turn.

This project was developed as part of the Mobile Application Development course.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional queue systems:
- Cause long physical waiting times
- Create overcrowded service areas
- Waste user time
- Reduce service efficiency

SmartQueue provides a digital and efficient alternative.


## 🚀 Features

### 👤 User Side (Mobile App)
- User registration and login
- View available service centers
- Join a queue remotely
- Real-time queue position tracking
- Estimated waiting time display
- Push notifications when turn is near
- Queue cancellation option

### 🏢 Admin Side
- Create and manage service queues
- Monitor active users in queue
- Call next user
- View queue analytics
- Manage service availability


## 🛠 Technologies Used

- intellij
- Kotlin / Java
- Firebase / SQLite (depending on implementation)
- REST API (if backend connected)
- Push Notifications


## 🧠 System Architecture

SmartQueue follows a client-server architecture:

- Mobile application (User Interface)
- Backend server for queue processing
- Database for storing user and queue data
- Real-time synchronization system

## 📊 Expected Impact
